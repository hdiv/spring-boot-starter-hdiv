spring-boot-starter-hdiv
========================

A spring-boot starter that simplifies the usage of the [HDIV](http://www.hdiv.org) library.

You only have to add this library to your Spring Boot project and a HDIV filter will be registered for you.

### Maven Integration
Add the following dependency to your ``pom.xml`` file:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.hdiv</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-hdiv</artifactId>
	<version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Have a look at https://github.com/hdiv/spring-boot-sample-hdiv for a sample Spring Boot + HDIV application.
